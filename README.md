# diffusion_JMEMS

This repo contains code used to estimate the diffusion coefficient of unpublished experimental data, share with caution. Data will not be uploaded to this repo, and instead shared in official channels such as microsoft's OneDrive.

Technically, the project will apply and compare equations (1) and (3) of the following publication:
